# Happy Tails App
Computer Science final project

Happy Tails is a mobile app that helps you connect with pets owners to find the perfect pet for your family. Our mission is to connect animal lovers with adorable pets that are looking for their forever homes. Whether you're looking to adopt a furry friend or find a loving home for an animal in need, Happy Tails is here to make the process seamless and joyful. For those seeking to adopt, our platform offers a wide range of lovable pets waiting to find their perfect match. You can browse through profiles, read animals descriptions, and view adorable photos of the animals available for adoption. When you find a pet that captures your heart, simply reach out to the animals page to start the adoption process. If you're looking to re home an animal, Happy Tails provides a simple and secure way to connect with potential adopters. You can create a detailed profile for your pet, highlighting their unique personality, preferences, descriptions and photos.
Together, we can create countless happy tails and make a lasting impact in the lives of animals.
